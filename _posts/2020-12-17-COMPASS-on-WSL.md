Just for information, COMPASS can run under WSL.

follow this tutorial: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#installing-wip

Some important points:

- you must register in the Microsoft Windows Insider Program in the dev channel in order to have a build version 20145 or higher
- Install the nvidia CUDA on WSL driver
- Install the cuda-toolkit-11-1 instead of the cuda-toolkit-11-0
- Do not choose the cuda, cuda-11-1, or cuda-drivers meta-packages under WSL 2

Afterwards, it's quite easy.

For the X11, you have to install Xming, tutorial: https://us191.ird.fr/spip.php?article77

Important points:

- Windows Terminal is pretty cool as an app
- in wsl's .bashrc, add:
`export DISPLAY = $ (cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $ 2}'): 0`
