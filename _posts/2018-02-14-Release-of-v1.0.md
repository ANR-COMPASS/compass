For the valentine's day, we can offer you to test new features on COMPASS:
 * kernel reduce uses thrust to have more repeatability
 * the pyr centroider method uses by default nosin_global method
 * cleaner implementation of sutra_controller::comp_voltage
 * cleaner implementation of sutra_source::raytrace
 * add default areas for SCAO models
 * factorization of shesha_simulator initializations
 * widget can take "-d" option to use specific devices (separated by comma)
