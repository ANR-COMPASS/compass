Today, an important update has been made on the project. 

Please, checkout on the *master* branch (the *develop* one is now deprecated and not used) and pull the update.

Off-axis WFS simulations and DM conjugated in altitude was not running correctly... Fortunately, we have solved the problem in this update.

The patch note follows:

- Turbulent layer size was not taking into account possible off-axis WFS --> corrected
- DM size was wrong if conjugated in altitude --> corrected
- Thanks to these debugs, MCAO works now
- Add possibility to set a negative margin_out in Param_dm, so actuators inside the pupil diameter can be filtered
