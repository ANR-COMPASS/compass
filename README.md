# What is COMPASS ?
The COMPASS platform was designed to meet the need of high-performance for the simulation of AO systems. The final product includes a software package for simulating all the critical subcomponents of AO, particularly in the context of the ELT and a real-time core based on several control approaches, with performances consistent with its integration into an instrument. Taking advantage of the specific hardware architecture of the GPU, the COMPASS tool allows to achieve adequate execution speeds to conduct large simulation campaigns caled to the ELT.
The COMPASS platform can be used to carry a wide variety of simulations to
both test specific components of AO of the E-ELT (such as wavefront analysis
device with a pyramid or elongated Laser star), and various systems
configurations such as multi-conjugate AO.
