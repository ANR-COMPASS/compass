I"Ó<h2 id="what-is-compass">What is COMPASS?</h2>

<p>The COMPASS platform was designed to meet the need of high-performance for the simulation of AO systems. The final product includes a software package for simulating all the critical subcomponents of AO, particularly in the context of the ELT and a real-time core based on several control approaches, with performances consistent with its integration into an instrument. Taking advantage of the specific hardware architecture of the GPU, the COMPASS tool allows to achieve adequate execution speeds to conduct large simulation campaigns caled to the ELT.
The COMPASS platform can be used to carry a wide variety of simulations to
both test specific components of AO of the E-ELT (such as wavefront analysis
device with a pyramid or elongated Laser star), and various systems
configurations such as multi-conjugate AO.</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>

<p>COMPASS is available on <a href="https://github.com/ANR-COMPASS/shesha.git">GitHub</a> for Linux platform only, equiped with a Nvidia GPU card.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a> to get all the dependencies.
The <a href="manual.html">user manual</a> is available.</p>

<p><strong>Please, check the News section to get informed of what‚Äôs new on COMPASS and of important update.</strong></p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>COMPASS computing performance is scalable according to the Nvidia GPU card used. A speed up of 9 has been reached with the last Nvidia V100 GPU compared to the project start‚Äôs state of the art GPU, without changing a single line of code.</p>

<p>Current performance leads to around 1 kHz for a SPHERE scale, 300 Hz for a SCAO ELT scale. Performance will continue to evolve with next GPU generations. Here is the performance obtained with the current state of the art Nvidia‚Äôs GPU V100 for various simulation scale and the evolution with GPU generation measured on a SCAO ELT scale.</p>
